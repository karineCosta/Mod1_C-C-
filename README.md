# C++ Exercises - University Assignments

This repository contains solutions to five C++ programming exercises from my university coursework. Each solution is implemented in a separate `.cpp` file, named according to the question number (e.g., `exercise1.cpp`, `exercise2.cpp`, etc.).

## Table of Contents

- [Exercise 1 - Largest of Two Numbers](#exercise-1---largest-of-two-numbers)
- [Exercise 2 - Age Classification](#exercise-2---age-classification)
- [Exercise 3 - Quadratic Equation Roots](#exercise-3---quadratic-equation-roots)
- [Exercise 4 - Grade Classification](#exercise-4---grade-classification)
- [Exercise 5 - Seasonal Classification](#exercise-5---seasonal-classification)

## Exercise 1 - Largest of Two Numbers

Write a program that reads two integer numbers and prints the larger of the two. If the numbers are equal, it should print a message indicating that they are equal.

---

## Exercise 2 - Age Classification

Write a program that reads a person's age and prints whether they are a minor (under 18), an adult (18-64 years), or elderly (65 years or older).

---

## Exercise 3 - Quadratic Equation Roots

Write a program that reads the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` of a quadratic equation (ax² + bx + c = 0) and determines whether the equation has two distinct real roots, one real root (equal roots), or complex roots.

---

## Exercise 4 - Grade Classification

Write a program that reads a grade between 0 and 100 and prints the corresponding grade classification:

- Grade between 0 and 49: F
- Grade between 50 and 59: D
- Grade between 60 and 69: C
- Grade between 70 and 79: B
- Grade between 80 and 100: A

If the user enters a number outside the range of 0-100, the program should print an error message.

## Exercise 5 - Seasonal Classification

Write a program that reads a month (represented by an integer between 1 and 12) and a day and prints the corresponding season for the Southern Hemisphere. Consider the following date ranges:

- Summer: December 21 to March 20
- Autumn: March 21 to June 20
- Winter: June 21 to September 20
- Spring: September 21 to December 20

The program should use nested or chained conditional statements to determine the season based on the month and day entered.

## Purpose

This project was developed as part of my university coursework in C++ programming. It demonstrates my ability to solve algorithmic problems and apply basic programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, and mathematical operations. It showcases my skills in C++, including implementing algorithms and solving real-world problems.
